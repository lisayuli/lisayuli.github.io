    <p>I will explored a recipe for traditional Chinese caramelized sweet potatoes called basi digua, that has been passed down through many generations on my dad’s side of the family (not through a physical written recipe but through show and practice). This dish is composed of sweet potato cubes that are coated in a layer of caramelized sugar that forms thin and transparent strings when pulled apart. It is usually served immediately from the pan alongside individual small bowls of cold water, in which the sweet potato cubes can be dunked in to cool down and solidify the sugar, giving it a crunchy exterior. I remember this being my childhood favorite, since my dad would always make it on special occasions such as birthdays and new years. It always generated a strong feeling of unity and harmony as the whole family would gather around this single plate of sweet potatoes, interconnected through a multitude of sticky strings of sugar. Even though the ingredients are simple, making this dessert requires a lot of experience with timing since getting the sugar to the right temperature and consistency requires high levels of precision.

This paper explores the origins of this dish, and the factors that could have allowed it to come to be, such as the effects of migration, trade, and famine. This will be done through legends and stories, scientific papers, and vessels, that will hopefully contextualize this dish in history as both a delicacy as well as a celebratory meal during times of droughts, famine, and changing culture.</p>

  <div class="blurb">
    <p>As Mexico entered the modern world in the late 20th century, it faced drastic shifts in national identity and social structure. The country was growing economically, and was attempting to stabilize from years of revolutions, foreign interventions, and massive debt. However, the resulting impact of these conflicts were deeply ingrained within social and political structures, and continued to fuel further turmoil that was hidden from the international eye. From peasant revolts, to student massacres, to a devastating earthquake, Mexico was struggling to ground itself as a stable, trustworthy, and responsible country. With the Summer Olympics coming to Mexico City in 1968, and overall wanting to strengthen international relations, the Mexican elite utilized contemporary architecture as a tool to portray Mexico as a reliable and modern country. Modernity and prosperity was only a reality for the highest classes, while the majority of the country was still suffering from the effects of decades of social, political, and economic instability. This created a facade of progress, while turning a blind eye to the dominating realities. Thus, the public response to these contemporary works began to reveal the large disparities between the city’s architecture and its people. The ways in which the masses interpreted and interacted with these works began to deviate from the architects’ original intentions. This exploration of contemporary works in Mexico City, in parallel with historical and social events, will demonstrate how Mexican contemporary architecture sought to paint Mexico as a first world utopia, but instead aggravated social inequities and promoted a mentality of nationalistic shame.
